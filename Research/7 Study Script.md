## Pilot / Study Script

- First of all, I would like to confirm that you have read and understood the explanatory statement, and consent to the use of data generated from this study to be used in my research.
    - [Give Link to Project]
    - Once you open this link, you will be greeted with a page with text and a button, please follow the instructions on it.
    - [Wait for participant to read the page, then click on the consent button]
    - While that loads up, I'll demonstrate how to interact with this game, and explain what your goals are.

- [Tutorial]
    - [Goals]
    - This Game seeks to teach Functional Programming to Novice Programmers through use of Visual Metaphors to bridge understanding from fundamental programming concepts to specifically functional programming concepts.
    - The Game loop is presented as a Box-and-Wire Visual Programming language, where you drag blocks around, and connect their inputs and outputs together.
    - The Game is based on the concept of Raid Bosses from MMORPGs, with each level in the game representing a single raid with a party of 3 against 1 boss.
    - Generally, each level will have the goal of defeating the boss, while keeping your party alive.
    - This is achieved through manipulating the Visual Programming language to deal with the bosses attacks, and attacking the boss when it is safe to do so.
    - The Visual Programming Language Code can be thought of as the AI or brains of each of the 3 party members.
    - At pre-set points, the boss will directly attack the party's AI, breaking functions into other functions, or altering how they are displayed.
    - You will then be given the opportunity to fix this damage before continuing the level.
    - [Objects]
    - This is a Function Block
        - It has an icon showing what function it is
        - It has one or more inputs
        - It has one or more outputs
        - The Inputs and Outputs display their type through Iconography
        - Functions can be curried through not connecting one or more inputs
        - Function Blocks without Inputs are information from the world, the raid battle
        - Function Blocks without Outputs control the world, the raid battle.
    - This is the Party UI
        - These top boxes show your party members Health, Mana, and Stamina bars
        - The Party Member Icon also appears down here on the Board, which shows a representation of the raid battle
        - This bottom box shows the stats of the Boss.
    - [Input]
    - [Demonstrate each input in the game as it is talked about]
    - There are 3 inputs that control this game, Mouse Left, Middle, and Right Click.
    - Mouse Middle is used to Pan the camera
    - When Clicking a Function Block
        - Mouse Right can be clicked and dragged to move the block around
    - When Clicking a Function Input or Output
        - Mouse Left can be clicked and dragged to connect Inputs and Outputs
        - Mouse Right can be used to break all connections
    - When Clicking the Party Menu
        - Mouse Left is used to switch to viewing that party members AI

- [Demonstration]
    - I will now walk through this first level, explaining my actions. Please ask questions if at any point you are unsure why I am doing something, or how I am doing it.
    - [Solve the Level]
    - You will be able to ask questions at any point during the study, but do you have any questions before starting? 
    - [Answer Questions]
    - Please share your screen, and then we can start the study.
    - If you can, please try to think out loud as you solve the 9 levels to assist data collection.
    - You can also ask questions or for hints if needed.

- [Study]
    - [Don't tell what functional programming concept it was, quiz on that at end of level ]
    - [Do not help the participant unprompted, unless required]
    - [Take Notes]
    - [Ask questions behaviour at the end of a level if needed]
    - [Ask what concept it was on at the end of a level]
        - [ Have a small conversation about this]

- [Survey]
    - Now that all tasks are completed, there is a short online survey to complete
    - [Provide Link]
    - Responses are anonymous, and will be carefully screened to remove any potentially identifying information before being saved.
    - Feel free to ask questions on the survey, and if you have additional comments you wish to be recorded, please tell them to me directly and I will record them down.
    - [Wait for Survey to be completed and Responses Submitted]
    - Thank you for your participation in this study. Have a good day.
