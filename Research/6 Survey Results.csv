If so, please briefly describe them.","Do you have any suggestions for improvements, to better be able to teach novice programmers functional programming through this game?",Do you have any final comments?,"Once this form has been submitted, it will not be possible to have your answers removed from the study, as the data will be anonymized and de-identified.

P1,6,2,4,5,3,5,6,2,6,2,6,2,A couple crashes when connecting things together.,The iconography could be improved but that could also be the resultant on the user rather than the game.,I think with refinement this could teach functional programming pretty well. While my brain is not on the wavelength required for functional programming this method of teaching is fairly error-proof and language-agnostic.,"Yes, I agree to have my responses be part of the study's data."
P2,4,4,6,6,7,3,6,1,5,3,5,3,General bugs as seen by supervisor,,,"Yes, I agree to have my responses be part of the study's data."
P3,5,4,5,4,6,3,6,2,3,3,5,1,"There were no issues that I had with interacting with the game aside from some already known bugs. Aside from this, I think that the game was very user friendly and the controls and visualizations were easy enough to understand given some time with the game.","Introducing functions on their own first and then asking the player to combine all of the smaller components at the end to make one functional program. This is in opposition to giving the player a simpler version of the program, with functions that aren't broken down, and then breaking them down in further tests. I think this is good as a method of understanding the underlying logic, but in my opinion I think a more efficient approach would be starting with the smaller components and working your way up, instead of starting with the entire program and breaking it down.","No I do not, I had a lot of fun and overall I think this was great for teaching me what functional programming is all about. I think the gamification succeeds in generating an interest and in making the concept more approachable.","Yes, I agree to have my responses be part of the study's data."
P4,5,3,6,5,5,4,3,2,2,4,4,3,,"Going over each of the blocks and giving a detailed explanation of what they do, rather than attempting to understand what idea they borrow from.","After I started warming up, the concepts were familiar, however it took a moment to get used to all the symbols. The symbols were actually pretty useful, but confused me initially.","Yes, I agree to have my responses be part of the study's data."
P5,4,2,5,5,5,4,5,1,5,6,3,1,Concepts from games could be brought in a lot better through either physical interaction or more clear icons. The chest specifically was a great representation of maybes but other than that I struggled to see transferred concepts.,More general tutorialisation and a more complete sequence and building from the ground up ,,"Yes, I agree to have my responses be part of the study's data."
P6,6,3,7,6,6,6,3,2,2,6,3,2,"The function blocks lacked adequate descriptions, without the asisstance of explanation it would be unclear as to what they did from their looks alone","Adding descriptions to the function blocks, providing actual code equivalents (if feasible) as to how the functions are changing in real time. Also, creating clusters of blocks to demonstrate the equivalence of functions from on level to another could prove useful","I think that the concept has potential to leverage gaming concepts to more easily onboard novice programmers, facilitating the learning of unfamiliar programming paradigms","Yes, I agree to have my responses be part of the study's data."
