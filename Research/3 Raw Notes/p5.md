- connected up the blocks instnatly correctly.
- recognises the LT function without prompting
- recognises the need to flip around the two int inputs

- solved level 1 effortlessly

- identified maybe quickly, and identified that const of fmap puts a function ine of a maybe
- struggled a bit with identifying we need to replace the value in the maybe

- phase 2 was really a struggle, didn't understand evne when found the solution

- recongise maybes, doesn't recognise const

- recognises the imagery of the lifta2 3 flaks

- levle 3

- look like comparison functions
- recongises LT, EQ, OR
- goes too quickly to reocngise well
- figures out what each block function deos independently, and is able to figure out the control flow for how to solv ehte levl

- phase 3

- able to connec tthe bind inputs striaght away, and from there solve the level.

- phase 4

- recognises the final step is the MAX
- solves the level, and finds out what every funciton does
- sees the from maybe once its actually used, but originally just connected the dots. Understands it after explanation

- sees a connection that the bind mixes the value in the flask, and understand rthe flask metaphor

- level 4

- realizes the goal of what the defender has to do, only from seeing the visual, before the xplanation.

- connects the inputs instantly, needs to switch the inputs around

- soles the next phase very quickly, once realising the sign has only 1 unput now

- solves the next pahse the same, realsies that they are unsure of the order of mathematical for +-, but quickly fixes it and aligns it.

- The level was literally mathematical functions being applied in certain orders
- no actual mathematical differnce once the function is borken in to compoentns

- the mathematical stuff amkes a lot more sense than the non mathemattical stuff

- level 5
- quickly solves it
- sees the canonical solution and the easy one
- recongises the NEQ
- connects up the inputs to the either and connecst them 

- once the either is connected solves the level quickly

- figure chain block as what I could get uot of it, but did not understand what it was actually doing
- chain of iethe ris hard to understand

- solves through values rather than understanding

- levle 6

- solves first phase quckly, sawa the input as a delta position
- solves the foldr afte rbeing reminded what const is
- starts connecting things up by matching inputs for phase 

- connects up for phase 4 and gets ticks too often, evnetually figures put that they only want a tick one frame at a time
- found a much easier solution for the seocnd last phase than intended

- last phase is attempting
- doesn't see the need for the fmap initially

- solved the final level, wiht some prompting
- took a while ot figure out why it was flipping

- final level

- needs more explanations of compoentns rather than making it a mystery
- there was low friction between the conecpts that I understand, but I am going in a little bit blind
- linking concepts from games, I did not see much of that, which is potentially a UI thing.
- this method of teaching is good for teaching to novices in gneral, if they start wiht this game and then move ito hakell as they will be able to aply it
- its quite hard to go from haskell to the game, you learn the concepts intuitively quite well
- as a full game, I would want syntax highlighting, hinting, and other programming language features
- its quite good in execution and how it is to use experientially
- for a novice programmer would absolutely be able to solve these question if they have a mind for it
- at a good pace, but not too fast
- the tasks I knew what I wanted to do, but I wasn't sure how to set up the particular things
- UI was great
- I expected tasks to take longer, and fiddling around with a stochastic approach it took less time
- not frustrating, but that may be due to beign a patient person
- make it more gamey, increase physical interacticity in a 3d space, or just have more information
- the icons that are being used could be any icon personally, random letters would have been just as good
-  the chest however was a great transferrable concept, and I was able to understand it as soon as I thought about what it might be.

- haskell experience, quite inexperienced and rusty, but quite familiar with functinoal concepts from maths
- outside of a maybe, I dont know much about haskell in general, I onyl remember the rudimentary stuff
- game
    - video games and tabletop games extremely familiar with both. Both game design and playing them
    - tabletop games I have not played as much, but know how engines are consturcted and how they are played and work.

- the 2 best levesl were
    - the first shielder level as there was the most instant grasp and understanding of
    - the best overall was the unexpected simpler solution as I found a solution more intuitive to me than the canonical solution
        - finding alternative solutions to a puzzle is something I like, especially beating dev times for example.

- level 3 was also nice since I was able to complete it which seemed to surprise the investigator

- each level seemd to have one concept
- levels 1 2 3 4 seemd to
- levels 5 and 6 I did not have a grounding, and because of that it semed like I did not have that grasp.
    - unfamiliarity

- thief was about changing position and not anything else.
    - thief and chest see the connection in retrospect
- defender was a not only changin position, but also changing something else simultaneously.
- as a programming concept it was about logical stuff / control flow
    - sees exactly what it is for each level one slightly prompted

- if this was a full game, I would play it independently with better presentation / obsfuscated presentation
- put down in front of it I would sit down and play it
- told it is teach functional progrmamming I would love to do it more.

- the seocnd level was my least favourite, as I was the most confused and was learning the game still
- suggests we need to ease players in
- presented with the 4th level as my first independent level would have been far better as an introduction.
