## Research Transparency
As part of the Honours Project, an Expert Review-styled study was conducted with 6 participants. 
To ensure repeatability and transparency of this research, anonymized study materials and data have been attached to this repository under Research/.

## Building locally
Not Recommended, several absolute paths are used in the project, and requires external tools as part of the build process.
If you would like to build locally regardless, the .uproject file should be edited to point to a local install of T4 Text Transformer, and the files in Preprocess/ will need to have their output directories updated.
